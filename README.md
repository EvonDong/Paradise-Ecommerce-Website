## Features

This e-commerce responsive website has a very stylish design with a key aim to provide a seamless, smooth experience for the users. I centered the theme around youthfulness by using various shades of blue to freshen up the display of the website. <br>

To exhibit the minimalistic aspect of the website, I made the side navbar slidable such that the website only emphasises on the important details. 

In addition, for products that are on sale, new, on popular demand or has free shipping, there are appropriate labels to deliver a relevant sense of urgency to purchase the product.

Finally, for additional security, I added an authentication feature that requires users to sign in / sign up using their username and password before they can add products to cart.


## Future Plans

1. By tracking the number of times of times the user clicked on a product, I am planning to track and recommend the potential products which he/she is highly likely to buy. This can also be used to tabulate sales statistics.

2. I am planning to add a feature which allows the user to suggest similar items from a picture of a product that the user wants.
