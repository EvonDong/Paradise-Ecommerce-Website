## Features

This e-commerce responsive website has a very stylish design with a key aim to provide a seamless, smooth experience for the users. I centered the theme around youthfulness by using various shades of blue to freshen up the display of the website. <br>

To exhibit the minimalistic aspect of the website, I made the side navbar slidable such that the website only emphasises on the important details. 

In addition, for cases where the products are on sale, new, on popular demand or has free shipping, there are also appropriate labels to deliver a relevant sense of urgency to purchase the product.
